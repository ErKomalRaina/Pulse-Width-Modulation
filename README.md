# Pulse-Width-Modulation(PWM)_Project
This is a Generating PWM Type Signal with variable Duty Cycle on FPGA, Field Programmabale Gate Array, project.
To Generate PWM signal by comparing input signal and carrier signal with variable duty cycle in VHDL language and load program on FPGA board and observe PWM on Oscilloscope.
